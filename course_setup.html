      <h2> Development </h2>

      </div>
      <p> The course intends to connect thinking and reflecting about the
        scientific method (depicted in the figure to the right). with practicing it in a virtual research laboratory. </p>
      <p> Originally, the course was envisioned as a modular course with three
        distinct parts: a generic part about the scientific method and
        philosophy of science, a domain specific part in which students where
        guided in practicing the scientific method, and a virtual laboratory
        that was needed to perform research in. </p>
      <p> However, in the first pilots with students, it became clear that this
        setup did not work well, because students were not able to see the
        connection between the various elements: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>between knowledge about science as an activity and philosophy of
          science</li>
        <li>between philosophy of science and the scientific method</li>
        <li>between philosophy of science and the knowledge of their own domain</li>
      </ul>
      <p> This has made us reconsider the setup radically. We decided to
        interweave the various aspects much more tightly. We realised that this
        stronger integration would endanger the intended modularity of the
        course. However, the course would gain in relevance to the students. </p>
      <h2>Setup of the course </h2>
      <div style="float: right;  width: 500px; margin:20px;"> <img src="figures/course_structure.png"

          alt="structure of the course" width="100%">
        <p><i>Overview of the structure of the course.</i></p>
      </div>
      <p> In the figure to the right the setup of the course is sketched. The
        course consists of six modules. In each module three aspects are
        combined: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Philosophy of science</b>: this entails both the historic context
          of the development of the scientific method (research cycle) and
          reflection by the students on their own role in science (through a
          personal science checklist)</li>
        <li><b>Methodology</b>: this entails the logic of the research cycle, as
          well as various generic scientific concepts as causality, feedbacks,
          validation and uncertainty.</li>
        <li><b>Domain knowledge</b>: the meteorology in the lower part of the
          atmosphere is used as the context in which philosophy of science and
          methodology are applied. An overarching research question connects the
          six modules</li>
      </ul>
      <p> In the first four modules the students work on all three aspects in an
        integrated way. In each module they traverse the research cycle which is
        our interpretation of the scientific method. From module one to module 4
        the emphasis shifts along the various steps in the research cycle.
        Furthermore, the degree to which the students are directed in their
        research gradually decreases from module 1 to module 4. </p>
      <p>To enable the students to develop and train their mastery of the
        scientific method, we provide them with a virtual laboratory in which
        they can perform their research. Initially, the intention was to develop
        a new online virtual laboratory, based on a conceptual model that we
        already use for education. However, along the way it was decided to use
        the <a href="https://classmodel.github.io/" title="CLASS model" target="_blank">downloadable
          version of the model</a> as it turned out that it worked equally well
        in combination with the online course.</p>

      <p>In the last two modules the students work on their own research
        project. In module 5 they develop their research project and describe
        that in a research proposal. In module 6 the students perform the actual
        research and describe their research and findings in a short report. In
        addition, they reflect both on their methodology and on their own
        research process vis-a-vis their personal science checklist.</p>
      <p>In all modules, mutual exchange between the students forms an essential
        part. This entails the regular use of discussion fora where students
        post their thoughts and findings, and provide each other feedback. In
        addition, in modules 5 and 6 peer feedback on the proposal and report is
        used as a way to improve the quality of the products and to train the
        students in their reflective skills.</p>
      <h2>Practical implementation</h2>
      <p>The course has been implemented in <a href="https://edge.edx.org/">EdX-Edge</a>
        to allow the course to be used both within the university and outside
        (as part of education at other universities, summer schools etc.). The
        work load of the course is 3 EC, roughly divided equally over the six
        modules.</p>
      <p>At <a href="www.wur.nl/en.htm">Wageningen University</a> the course is
        used within a blended course <a href="https://ssc.wur.nl/Handbook/Course/MAQ-51803">Learn
          the Scientific Method in a changing climate</a> which runs for 6
        weeks. The online course is supported by a weekly class-room session of
        about 1 hour. This meeting is mainly devoted to continuing some of the
        online discussions and clarifying certain concepts. Furthermore,
        practical and organizational issues. The course is supported by a
        Brightspace course (the standard Electronic Learning Environment at
        Wageningen University). Brightspace is used for communication with the
        students about practical matters related the course (both through e-mail
        and via a discussion forum). Furthermore, the Brightspace course is used
        to hand-in the proposal and report, and for the administration of the
        grading.</p>
      <h2>Re-use</h2>
      <p>The course has been developed with re-use in mind. The first method of
        re-use we envision is that the domain-related part (both the theoretical
        background and the virtual laboratory) could be replaced by theory and a
        laboratory from another domain. Furthermore, there are a number of
        learning trajectories that could be used separately as part of other
        courses. These trajectories are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">philosophy
            of science related to </span>the scientific method</li>
        <li>the personal science checklist through which students reflect on
          their own principles related to scientific research</li>
        <li>the scientific method itself</li>
        <li>the theory on the atmospheric boundary layer and cloud formation
          (domain-specific)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These learning trajectories have been interweaved within the course to
        optimally make the connection. However, at the same time they can easily
        be identified, based on the icons that are used in the course.</p>
