      <h3>Original plan</h3>
      <p>Originally it was envisioned that the entire course would run online,
        in the browser. This would include the virtual laboratory that would be
        based on the <a href="https://classmodel.github.io/">offline CLASS
          model</a> (available as a download for Windows, Mac and Linux). The
        online version of CLASS was intended to be developed in a Jupyter
        notebook that could be served online from a Jupyter notebook server.</p>
      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>During the development of the course, and in particular during the
        pilots with students, it turned out that the offline version of the
        CLASS model served equally well as a virtual laboratory. Given the fact
        that it is available for all major operating systems (the cross-platform
        availability of a browser-based solution was less relevant. Therefore it
        was decided to halt the further development of the Juptyer notebook
        version of CLASS (CLASS-notebook) for the duration of the project.</p>
      <h3>Current status</h3>
      The current development version of CLASS-notebook can be accessed at
      <a href="https://github.com/scientific-method-course/course-files/tree/master/class-notebook">Github</a>.<br>
