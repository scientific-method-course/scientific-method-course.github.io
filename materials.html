    <div class="container">The course has been developed with re-use in mind.
      The first method of re-use we envision is that the domain-related part
      (both the theoretical background and the virtual laboratory) could be
      replaced by theory and a laboratory from another domain. In addition some
      more generic assessment and instruction material could be re-used.</div>

      <h3>Contents: 4 learning paths</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="container">The course contains four learning paths (see <a href="course_setup.html">Course
        setup</a>) that could be used separately as part of other courses. These
      paths are:
      <ul>
        <li><span><a href="documents/Scientific_method_paths_philosophy.pdf">philosophy
              of science</a> related to </span>the scientific method</li>
        <li>the <a href="documents/Scientific_method_paths_checklist.pdf">personal
            science checklist </a>through which students reflect on their own
          principles related to scientific research</li>
        <li>the <a href="documents/Scientific_method_paths_methodology.pdf">scientific
            method</a> itself</li>
        <li>the theory on the <a href="documents/Scientific_method_paths_domain.pdf">atmospheric
            boundary layer and cloud formation</a> (domain-specific)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These learning paths have been interwoven within the course to
        optimally make the connection. However, at the same time they can easily
        be identified, based on the icons that are used in the course. The
        structure is analysed in a <a href="documents/Scientific_method_paths.xlsx">spreadsheet
          </a>that may serve to disentangle the learning paths. As the texts in
        the course are still evolving (based on feedback from the students), the
        we suggest to extract the contents of the learning paths from the EdX
        course.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3> Rubrics for formative and summative assessment </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="documents/METEOx-Module%205-rubric_proposal.pdf">Rubric for
            research proposal</a></li>
        <li><a href="documents/METEOx-Module%206-rubric_report.pdf">Rubric for
            research report</a><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Instruction materials for writing skills.</h3>
      <p> In the course two documents are used: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="documents/W.2_W.3_Academic_writing_-_structure_of_a_scientific_text%20.pdf">Structure
            of a scientific text</a></li>
        <li><a href="documents/W.6_Academic_writing_-_figures_and_tables.pdf">Design
            of figures and tables</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional instructions are <a href="https://git.wur.nl/Moene001/bwa-skills/tree/master/Writing">available
          </a>as part of the development of a skills learning trajectory at
        Wageningen University. </p>
      <h3>Illustrations</h3>
      <p>The figures/illustrations used in the course are provided in a <a href="documents/illustrations.zip">zip-file</a></p>
