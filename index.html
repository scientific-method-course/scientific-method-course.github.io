    There is often a disconnect between education in scientific methods and its
    use in practice. As a result, students find it difficult to apply the
    methods later on. Wageningen University has developing a modular online
    course that aims to bridge the gap between learning and application. The
    development was financed by the Dutch Ministry of Education under <a href="https://www.surf.nl/files/2019-03/factheet-the-scientific-method---learning-by-doing.pdf">Open
and
      Online Education incentive scheme</a>.<br>
