Method - an online course</h1>
<p class="western">There is often a disconnect between education in
scientific methods and its use in practice. As a result, students
find it difficult to apply the methods later on. Wageningen
University has developing a modular online course that aims to bridge
the gap between learning and application. The development was
financed by the Dutch Ministry of Education under <a href="https://www.surf.nl/files/2019-03/factheet-the-scientific-method---learning-by-doing.pdf">Open
and Online Education incentive scheme</a>.</p>
